# foliumSuperheros
Play around with Folium Library to create Maps, Markers and Custom Markers.

folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js library. 
Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in a Leaflet map via folium.
For further details see the folium docs https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/blob/master/README.rst
